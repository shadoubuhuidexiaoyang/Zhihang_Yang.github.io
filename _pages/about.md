I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Information Engineering](https://xxgc.nxu.edu.cn/), [Ningxia University](https://www.nxu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes path planning and computer vision.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhang](https://cxcy.nxu.edu.cn/info/1425/18985.htm) of Ningxia Key Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Information Security for Channeling Computing Resources from the East to the West from [School of Information Engineering](https://xxgc.nxu.edu.cn/), [Ningxia University](https://www.nxu.edu.cn/).
